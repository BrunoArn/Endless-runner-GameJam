Hungry Worm is an endless runner created during the Brackeys gameJam in 2025 where you control a nimble worm trying to travel as far as possible through a winding tunnel.
Eat biscuits to grow your score (and maybe your ego), but be careful: the farther you go, the harder it gets.

##

- 🎮 Gameplay
  - Objective: Travel as far as you can while avoiding the walls.
  - Scoring: Each biscuit you eat increases your score and distance multiplier.
  - Challenge: The game becomes progressively faster and more difficult as your distance increases.
  - Procedural Generation: The tunnel layout is procedurally generated, making every run unique.
